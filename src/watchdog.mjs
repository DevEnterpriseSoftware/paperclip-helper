// Watchdog: wake agents whose work Paperclip left stalled.
//
// 1. Dropped hand-offs (paperclipai/paperclip#13769, #13880). When an issue
//    changes hands (engineer → reviewer, reviewer → engineer, …) Paperclip
//    cancels the finishing run, which still holds the environment lease for a
//    minute or two. The new owner's wake is refused ("has not released its
//    environment lease") and never retried. The watchdog finds issues whose
//    owner never started after a hand-off and comments on them, which wakes
//    the assignee, as you would by hand.
//
// 2. Blocked issues whose blockers are all done. Paperclip should wake the
//    assignee with issue_blockers_resolved, but that wake can be dropped the
//    same way. They get the same kind of comment once quiet for the stall window.
//
// 3. Done blockers whose workspace clean-up failed. A blocker is done, but the
//    clean-up of its workspace (workspace_finalize) failed, typically because
//    the run was cancelled at a hand-off while syncing back. Paperclip then
//    treats the blocker as unresolved forever and skips every wake for the
//    dependent. With WATCHDOG_HEAL_FAILED_FINALIZE on, the watchdog removes such
//    blockers from the dependent's "Blocked by", moves it to todo if nothing
//    else blocks it, and explains why in a comment that also wakes the assignee.
//
// 4. Wakes deferred behind a run that still holds execution. A comment can't
//    help: its wake is deferred too. The watchdog logs it once and, with
//    WATCHDOG_RETRY_DEFERRED on, presses Paperclip's own "send queued messages
//    now" (queued-comments/interrupt). For a stopped run that grants one extra
//    clean-up attempt on the run's environment lease, then re-sends the saved
//    comments. It never interrupts a running run.
//
// 5. Recovery holds left by a hand-off. Paperclip's recovery can give up on a
//    run that was cancelled when the issue changed hands ("Automatic recovery
//    blocked", board decision required) and mark the issue blocked, with the
//    saved messages waiting. With WATCHDOG_RETRY_DEFERRED on, the watchdog
//    delivers them to the current owner, as the board's Interrupt button does.
//    A hold with any other cause is only reported: that decision stays yours.
//
// Nudges and retries are capped per situation (WATCHDOG_MAX_NUDGES) and spaced
// by the stall window. Their counts are kept in the state file across restarts.
